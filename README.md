# PortalRangeFinder
Visualize nether portal connection regions, including overlaps

Nether portal interference is a complex nuisance to work with, so I made this mod to cut out the guesswork.

Currently no palyer-usable mechanics are implemented. Initial commit was made when mesh representation, planar slicing, and rendering were figured out.
Turns out that nether portal interference is *even more intricate* than I had previously thought, so this will take a bit of work to do perfectly correctly.
